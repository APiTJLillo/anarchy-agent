# Anarchy Agent - System Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the Anarchy Agent system, a fully local, cross-platform AI assistant that uses the Anarchy-Inference language as its action language.

## System Overview

Anarchy Agent is designed as a modular system with several key components that work together to create an autonomous agent capable of planning and executing tasks using the Anarchy-Inference language.

## Core Components

### 1. Core Module

The Core module serves as the central coordinator for the entire system, managing the flow of information between components and orchestrating the agent's operation.

**Responsibilities:**
- Initialize and manage all system components
- Handle user input and system output
- Coordinate the planning and execution loop
- Manage error handling and recovery
- Provide logging and monitoring

### 2. LLM Engine

The LLM Engine integrates with a quantized open-source language model to provide the intelligence for the agent.

**Responsibilities:**
- Load and manage the local LLM model
- Process prompts and generate responses
- Optimize token usage for efficiency
- Handle context management
- Generate Anarchy-Inference code based on task descriptions

### 3. Planner

The Planner module is responsible for breaking down user tasks into actionable steps using the Anarchy-Inference language.

**Responsibilities:**
- Analyze user tasks and generate plans
- Break complex tasks into simpler subtasks
- Prioritize and sequence actions
- Handle planning failures and replanning
- Maintain task state and progress

### 4. Executor

The Executor module safely runs Anarchy-Inference code in a sandboxed environment.

**Responsibilities:**
- Parse and validate Anarchy-Inference code
- Execute code in a secure sandbox
- Capture and process execution results
- Handle execution errors and exceptions
- Provide execution metrics and logs

### 5. Memory

The Memory module stores and retrieves information from previous executions and interactions.

**Responsibilities:**
- Store execution history and results
- Maintain agent state across sessions
- Provide context for the LLM
- Implement efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms
- Handle data persistence

### 6. Browser

The Browser module enables web automation and interaction.

**Responsibilities:**
- Provide headless browser functionality
- Handle page navigation and interaction
- Extract content from web pages
- Manage cookies and sessions
- Implement browser automation using Anarchy-Inference symbols

### 7. System

The System module interfaces with the operating system for file and process operations.

**Responsibilities:**
- Provide file system operations
- Execute shell commands securely
- Manage processes and resources
- Handle OS-specific functionality
- Implement system operations using Anarchy-Inference symbols

### 8. UI

The UI module provides the user interface for interacting with the agent.

**Responsibilities:**
- Display agent status and output
- Accept user input and commands
- Show execution progress
- Provide debugging information
- Offer configuration options

## Data Flow

1. **User Input → Core → Planner**
   - User provides a task description
   - Core processes the input and sends it to the Planner
   - Planner uses the LLM to generate a plan in Anarchy-Inference code

2. **Planner → Executor**
   - Planner sends Anarchy-Inference code to the Executor
   - Executor validates and runs the code in a sandbox

3. **Executor → System/Browser/Memory**
   - Executor interacts with system resources, browser, or memory as needed
   - Results are captured and returned to the Executor

4. **Executor → Core → UI**
   - Execution results flow back to the Core
   - Core updates the UI with results and status
   - Core decides whether to continue execution or request user input

## Implementation Details

### Anarchy-Inference Integration

The Anarchy-Inference language is used as the "action language" for the agent, with its symbolic syntax providing a token-efficient way to express operations:

- File operations: `📂`, `📖`, `✍`, etc.
- Shell execution: `!`
- HTTP requests: `↗`, `↓`
- Browser automation: `🌐`, `🖱`, `⌨`, etc.
- Memory operations: `📝`, `📖`, `🗑`

### Sandboxing and Security

The Executor implements a secure sandbox for running Anarchy-Inference code:

- Permission-based access control for system resources
- Resource usage limits and timeouts
- Isolation from the host system
- Audit logging of all operations

### LLM Integration

The system uses a quantized open-source LLM (e.g., Mistral 7B) for planning and code generation:

- Local model loading and inference
- Prompt engineering for effective code generation
- Context management to maintain coherence
- Fallback mechanisms for handling model limitations

### Cross-Platform Support

The agent is designed to work across different operating systems:

- Rust backend for performance and portability
- Tauri frontend for cross-platform UI
- OS-specific adapters in the System module
- Platform-agnostic core functionality

## Extension Points

The architecture is designed to be extensible in several ways:

1. **Custom Tools**: New capabilities can be added by implementing additional Anarchy-Inference symbols
2. **Alternative LLMs**: Different local models can be integrated through the LLM Engine
3. **UI Customization**: The UI can be extended or replaced while maintaining the core functionality
4. **Plugin System**: Future versions may support a plugin architecture for third-party extensions

## Development Roadmap

1. **MVP**: Basic planning and execution loop with core functionality
2. **Alpha**: Complete implementation of all modules with basic integration
3. **Beta**: Refined user experience and expanded capabilities
4. **Release**: Stable version with comprehensive documentation and examples
