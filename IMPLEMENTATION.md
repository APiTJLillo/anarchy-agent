# Anarchy Agent - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed information about the implementation of the Anarchy Agent project, a fully local, cross-platform AI assistant that uses the Anarchy-Inference language as its action language.

## Components

The Anarchy Agent consists of several core modules, all implemented using the Anarchy-Inference language:

### Core Module

The Core module (`core.a.i`) serves as the central coordinator for the entire system, managing the flow of information between components and orchestrating the agent's operation. It provides methods for:

- Initializing all components
- Running tasks using natural language descriptions
- Running Anarchy-Inference code directly
- Shutting down the agent

### Planner Module

The Planner module (`planner.a.i`) is responsible for breaking down user tasks into actionable steps using the Anarchy-Inference language. It provides methods for:

- Generating Anarchy-Inference code from task descriptions
- Creating prompts for the LLM
- Validating generated code
- Managing context from previous executions

### Executor Module

The Executor module (`executor.a.i`) safely runs Anarchy-Inference code in a sandboxed environment. It provides methods for:

- Parsing and executing Anarchy-Inference code
- Registering symbol handlers for various operations
- Managing the execution sandbox
- Handling execution errors

### Memory Module

The Memory module (`memory.a.i`) stores and retrieves information from previous executions and interactions. It provides methods for:

- Storing task results
- Retrieving context for new tasks
- Managing key-value storage
- Formatting context for the LLM

### Browser Module

The Browser module (`browser.a.i`) enables web automation and interaction. It provides methods for:

- Opening web pages
- Clicking on elements
- Inputting text
- Extracting content
- Executing JavaScript

### System Module

The System module (`system.a.i`) interfaces with the operating system for file and process operations. It provides methods for:

- File operations (read, write, list, etc.)
- Shell command execution
- Environment variable access
- OS information retrieval

## String Dictionary

All strings used throughout the application are stored in a central string dictionary (`string_dictionary_updated.a.i`). This approach:

- Reduces token usage for LLMs
- Follows the minimalist design philosophy of Anarchy-Inference
- Makes the codebase more maintainable
- Allows for easier localization

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive testing:

- Component tests (`test_components.a.i`) - Tests each module individually
- Integration tests (`integration_test.a.i`) - Tests how modules work together
- End-to-end tests (`end_to_end_test.a.i`) - Tests the complete application flow

## Bug Fixes

Several bug fixes and improvements have been implemented in `bug_fixes.a.i`:

1. Proper error handling for file paths in main_updated.a.i
2. Error handling for code execution in executor.a.i
3. Timeout handling for browser operations in browser.a.i
4. Fallback for missing keys in memory.a.i
5. Path validation in system.a.i
6. Context length limiting in planner.a.i

## Usage

The Anarchy Agent can be used in several ways:

- Running a specific Anarchy-Inference file
- Running an example from the examples directory
- Running in REPL mode for interactive use
- Running in interactive mode with natural language input

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for future improvement include:

- Enhanced LLM integration with more sophisticated prompting
- Expanded browser automation capabilities
- Improved memory management with vector storage
- Additional system operation symbols
- User interface improvements

## Conclusion

The Anarchy Agent implementation provides a fully functional, cross-platform AI assistant that operates entirely offline using the Anarchy-Inference language. The modular architecture allows for easy extension and customization, while the minimalist design ensures efficiency and simplicity.
